title: Namespaces
---

Upstash Vector allows you to partition a single index into multiple isolated namespaces.
Each namespace functions as a self-contained subset of the index, in which read and write
requests are only limited to one namespace.

Each vector index will have at least one, the default namespace, and optionally many more
namespaces.

When no namespace is specified, the operations will use the default namespace, which has
the name of `""` (empty string).

<Note>
    Indexes created before the namespaces feature is introduced can still be used
    as they are, with no change at all. All the previous operations on them will be assumed 
    to have been done in the default namespace.

## Using a Namespace

Namespaces are implicitly created when a read or write operation is made, so there
is no special endpoint for creating a namespace.

For example, the code snippet below will create the namespace `ns`, if it does not
already exist, upsert and query the vector only on that namespace.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"id":"4", "vector":[0.9215,0.3897,....]}' \
  -X POST \
  $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/upsert/ns

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"vector":[0.9215,0.3897,...], "topK" : 5}' \
  $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/query/ns
```

All the read and write operations accept optional namespace name in their paths to 
restrict that operation to a particular namespace in an index.

## Deleting a Namespace

Namespaces can be deleted as follows, by using the 
[Delete Namespace](../api/endpoints/delete-namespace) API.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
    -X DELETE \
    $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/delete-namespace/ns
```

## Listing Namespaces

All the active namespaces can be listed as follows, by using the
[List Namespaces](../api/endpoints/list-namespaces) API.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
    $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/list-namespaces
```
